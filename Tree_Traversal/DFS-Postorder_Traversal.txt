Algorithm Postorder(tree) :-

Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Postorder(left->subtree)
Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Postorder(right->subtree)
Visit the root

Uses of Postorder:-

Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree. Please see the question for the deletion of a tree for details. Postorder traversal is also useful to get the postfix expression of an expression tree


CODE :- 

void printPostorder(struct Node* node)
{
    if (node == NULL)
        return;
 
    // First recur on left subtree
    printPostorder(node->left);
 
    // Then recur on right subtree
    printPostorder(node->right);
 
    // Now deal with the node
    cout << node->data << " ";
}
