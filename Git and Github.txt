Git and Github :-

Git is a version control system

After inistalling the github first time you must be configure the github

git config --global user.name "shivdatta dixit"
git config --global user.email "shivdattadixit0567@gmail.com"
git config --list

Deploying A project:-

Clone :- cloning the repo in our system

git clone https://github.com/shivdattadixit0567/Counter.git

After the cloning if file is not modified then nothing happens
but if modified or if any file is untracked (newly file created) then we have to do these two operation

git status - modified file or untracked file

git add <file name>
git status - staged (ready to be commited)

git commit -m"message"
git status - commited

git push origin main (to upload newly created file or modified file)
git status - file is uploaded to github
