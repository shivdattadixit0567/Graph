Flood Fill Algorithm

An image is represented by the 2-D array of integers and each integer is representing the pixel value of
of the image

given the coordinate (sr,sc) representing the starting pixel of the flood fill and pixel value newColor

To perform the flood fill , consider the starting pixel plus any pixel of same color connected 4-Directionally to the starting pixel

Replace the color of all selected pixel with newColor


ANS :- we can use the dfs and bfs both for this algorithm , simply apply any of the algo and get the ans
